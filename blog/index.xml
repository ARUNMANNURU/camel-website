      <description>The Apache Camel community is excited to have such a great response and effort already put in by the Outreachy applicants. We are grateful to all that contributed with code, ideas, helping others and being a part of our community.
We received similar inquiries from several applicants, asking help with the timeline for the final application, intern selection criteria and similar. To help answer this and to be transparent to all involved, so each individual can reflect and make informed decisions, here are some of our thoughts.</description>

      <title>Apache Camel 2020 Release Schedule</title>
      <link>https://camel.apache.org/blog/LTS-Release-Schedule/</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 06 Mar 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://camel.apache.org/blog/LTS-Release-Schedule/</guid>
      <description>The Apache Camel project is moving to release schedule with Long Term Support (LTS) and non-LTS releases.
The plan is to have 2 yearly LTS releases and then non-LTS releases in between.
This allows the Camel project to innovate and move much faster in non-LTS releases.
And as well to offer production stable branches (LTS) where end users can stay on for a longer period of time and get CVEs and important/critical bug fixes only.</description>

The aim of this post is giving a full perspective of what will change for the end users and the roadmap for new features.
New components Except camel-aws-xray, which is a particular component needing much more work to be migrated, all the original AWS components have been migrated to AWS SDK v2.</description>

      <description>Have you built a new great Web API for your product? Wouldn&amp;rsquo;t be wonderful to have it available as a part of the great Apache Camel component family? We would love it.
The community just released Camel 3 which is more modular, lightweight and already includes lots of components (300+) to quickly integrate various systems consuming or producing data. All of these components can be used with the same integration domain specific language (DSL) based on the famous Enterprise Integration Patterns (EIPs).</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been working at the European Commission for the last 4 years as a Software Architect, working for a unit responsible for developing reusable components, and advocating open source software. In this context, we organized already a couple of Hackathons and Bug bounties open to all the open source communities.
In the team, we worked already a couple of times with Apache Camel, and I like the elegance and performance compared with other integration frameworks.</description>

      <guid>https://camel.apache.org/blog/Camel-Kafka-connector-intro/</guid>
      <description>The Apache Camel community introduces a new subproject in the ecosystem: Camel-Kafka-Connector. This project born as a PoC exploring the possibility of leveraging the Apache Camel components as Kafka source and sink connectors. The main idea behind the project is reusing the Camel Components&amp;rsquo; flexibility in a simple way, through a configuration file mixing Kafka Connect configuration and Camel route definitions and options.
What is Kafka Connect? It is an Apache Kafka&amp;rsquo;s framework that defines a standardized way to stream data in and out a kafka broker.</description>

      <description>Apache Camel 3 was released last thursday November 28th 2019, which also happens to be the day of the US Thanksgiving. This was not intentionally but we can say its a big thanks from us to the community with a brand new major version of Camel - this does not come often by. In fact, its 10 years since Camel 2 hit the streets. So this 3rd generation is long overdue.</description>
