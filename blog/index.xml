      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been working at the European Commission for the last 4 years as a Software Architect, working for a unit responsible for developing reusable components, and advocating open source software. In this context, we organized already a couple of Hackathons and Bug bounties open to all the open source communities.
In the team, we worked already a couple of times with Apache Camel, and I like the elegance and performance compared with other integration frameworks.</description>

      <description>The Apache Camel community introduces a new subproject in the ecosystem: Camel-Kafka-Connector. This project born as a PoC exploring the possibility of leveraging the Apache Camel components as Kafka source and sink connectors. The main idea behind the project is reusing the Camel Components&amp;rsquo; flexibility in a simple way, through a configuration file mixing Kafka Connect configuration and Camel route definitions and options.
What is Kafka Connect? It is an Apache Kafka&amp;rsquo;s framework that defines a standardized way to stream data in and out a kafka broker.</description>

In fact its 10 years since Camel 2 hit the streets. So this 3rd generation is long overdue.</description>
