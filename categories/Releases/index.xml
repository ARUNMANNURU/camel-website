      <description>A few days ago Apache Camel 3.2 was released. This is a continuation of the work we are doing on Camel leading up to the first long term support release (LTS) that would be either Camel 3.3 or 3.4.
In case you have missed this, the release model in Camel 3.x is following the principe of LTS and non-LTS releases (like Java JDKs). For more details see this blog post.</description>

      <description>Apache Camel 3 was released last thursday November 28th 2019, which also happens to be the day of the US Thanksgiving. This was not intentionally but we can say its a big thanks from us to the community with a brand new major version of Camel - this does not come often by. In fact, its 10 years since Camel 2 hit the streets. So this 3rd generation is long overdue.</description>
