      <description>Apache Camel 3 was released last thursday November 28th 2019, which also happens to be the day of the US Thanksgiving. This was not intentionally but we can say its a big thanks from us to the community with a brand new major version of Camel - this does not come often by. In fact its 10 years since Camel 2 hit the streets. So this 3rd generation is long overdue.</description>
