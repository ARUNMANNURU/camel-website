      <description>Today I continue me practice on youtube and recorded a 10 minute video on creating a new Camel and Quarkus project that includes Rest and HTTP services with health checks and metrics out of the box.
Then comparing the memory usage of running the example in JVM mode vs native compiled with GraalVM. Then showing for the finale how to quickly run 100 instances of the example each on their own TCP port and how quick Camel are to startup and service the first requests faster than you can type and click.</description>
