      <description>Welcome to the 2.18.0 release which resolved over 500 issues. This is first release that requires Java 8 and comes with a much-improved Spring Boot support, and ships with numerous new features, improvements and bug fixes.
 Java DSL with experimental Java8 functional/lambda support. Check out the camel-example-java8. We love feedback on this DSL and expect to improved the API over the next couple of releases. The XSD schema for &amp;lt;camelContext&amp;gt; and its other configuration elements are now also documented (before it was only &amp;lt;routes&amp;gt; and &amp;lt;rests&amp;gt;).</description>
