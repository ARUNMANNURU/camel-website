from(&amp;quot;file:c:/tmp/in&amp;quot;) .to(&amp;quot;file:/c:/tmp/out&amp;quot;); If you are using Windows, create an file with a name like &amp;quot;$simple{&amp;lt;some malicious code&amp;gt;}&amp;quot; (without the quotes) and drop it into the &amp;ldquo;c:/tmp/in&amp;rdquo; directory. The file consumer will read and process this file. It will also set the Exchange in Message Header &amp;lsquo;CamelFileName&amp;rsquo; with the value &amp;quot;$simple{&amp;lt;some malicious code&amp;gt;}&amp;quot;. In the next step, the file producer will interpreted the value of this header as simple language expression and execute the malicious code.</description></item></channel></rss>
